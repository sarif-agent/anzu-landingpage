Flexbox landing page project with the cosplayer "anzujaamu's" theme.

It was a fun work to do.

// Hello! When I started building this website, my priority was to experiment with some flexbox layouts. As I continued to work on the site, I designed it with the concept of a promotional brochure for a cosplayer. I chose Anzu-Jaamu, a cosplayer from my own country, as the subject. I had a lot of fun preparing this site and learned a bunch of new tricks, especially while tinkering with CSS Vanilla animations. For more information on these animations, you can check here:
